        <div class="para">
            Viplav is an employee in BSNL and the son of Lenin Sathyam. Vexed with being in the same city since his birth, he takes a transfer to Kashmir so that he can enjoy the peace and nature. After arriving in Kashmir, he notices that the reality is quite different from his expectations as there is a war going on between both sides of the line of control and a curfew being placed every other day, stopping his access to stores and restaurants. He meets up with his colleague Pitobash, with whom he also shares a room.

Unable to bear living in the present conditions of Kashmir, Viplav urges his superior Zoya to transfer him again to Hyderabad. That is when he chances upon "Aara" Begum and immediately falls in love with her. She is there with her friend to visit the Mamaleshwar Temple so that her grandmother's knee pain can be healed. When followed by Viplav, her friend gives him a false story that they are from Pakistan and are there to find Aara's younger brother Feroz who was lost in the ensuing conflicts between the two nations. Being honest and helpful in nature, Viplav helps Aara get to the temple and finds Feroz in the process, saving the siblings from a group of Kashmiri Muslims who try to attack them. Aara eventually falls in love with Viplav as well, but she decides to go back to Pakistan without confessing her love. Viplav catches up to her at the railway station, where he comes to know her true identity, Chadarangam Aaradhya. Both confess their love for each other, and they also come to know that their fathers are bitter rivals.

Viplav's father Sathyam is an atheist, and Aaradhya's father, Srinivasa Rao, is a spiritual personality in Kakinada, coming from an orthodox and conservative Brahmin household; both of them had a verbal sparring when they were asked to be chief guests for a live television debate. They try to get their parents to meet each other in the Hyderabad Metro. Sathyam is receptive to Viplav's wish to marry Aradhya; however, Srinivasa Rao is skeptical, as the pair's horoscopes do not really match and foresee hardships if they marry. Hence, Viplav and Aaradhya get married against their parents' wishes even though Srinivasa Rao predicts that they will not be able to live happily and will not have children until both Viplav and Sathyam do a homam, together. The pair moves into an apartment, and their married life slowly starts to come together. Both become good friends with Zoya and her husband Thomas. One year later, Aaradhya becomes pregnant. When she and Viplav visit the hospital, they are both informed that she has suffered a miscarriage.
